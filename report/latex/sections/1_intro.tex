\section{Introduction}
The goal of this project is to explore how cloud computing services can be utilized to develop scalable, fast, and highly available backend systems. Specifically, we design and implement a backend service for a hospital management system, inspired by the MIMIC-III database. The system supports operations for managing patient data, medical admissions, progress reports, media files, and doctor-patient communication through questions and replies. All backend functionality adheres to standard REST API conventions.

To ensure robustness and scalability, the system leverages Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. AppEngine is used to deploy RESTful services, Cloud Storage for managing media (BLOB) files, and a database service for structured data storage. Additionally, Google Cloud Functions are employed for serverless computing tasks, such as periodic updates and maintenance functions. 

The backend supports essential operations such as creating and updating patients, admissions, and medical progress, while also managing media uploads/downloads, patient questions and calculating waiting times.
