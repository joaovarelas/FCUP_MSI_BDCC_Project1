This project demonstrates the effective use of GCP services to build a scalable and reliable hospital backend system. Google App Engine provides a flexible environment for the REST API, while Cloud SQL ensures secure data management with high availability. Cloud Storage efficiently handles multimedia files, and Google Cloud Functions optimize real-time data processing.

By leveraging these tools, the system can manage hospital workflows like patient admissions, medical records, and progress tracking, ensuring performance under high demand through load testing and multi-region deployment. 

Overall, the system is designed for scalability, reliability, and some security.
